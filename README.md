1.🚀 Project Overview

🚀 Project Overview:

This project is part of the Cloud Track in our Software Engineering bootcamp at Masterschool. The application was originally developed by Alejandro Román, our Track Mentor (huge thanks to him!). Our task was to design and deploy its AWS infrastructure step by step, implementing each component individually.

🌐 AWS Services Used:

🖥️ EC2 Instance: Deployed virtual servers to run the application.

🏢 Application Load Balancer (ALB): Ensured high availability and traffic distribution across instances.

💾 RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed and scaled the database with ease.

🗂️ S3 Bucket: Stored and managed static files for the application.

Instead of a manual setup, I took the challenge further by fully automating the provisioning and deployment using Terraform. This approach ensures a scalable, repeatable, and error-resistant deployment process, eliminating the need for manual configurations.

For details about the application's features, functionality, and local installation, refer to the original README.md by Alejandro.
