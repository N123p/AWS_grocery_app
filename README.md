 ## 🚀 Project Overview:

This project is part of the Cloud Track in our Software Engineering bootcamp at Masterschool. The application was originally developed by Alejandro Román, our Track Mentor (A big Thanks to him!). Our task was to design and deploy its AWS infrastructure step by step, implementing each component individually.


 ### 🌐 AWS Services Used:
- 🖥️ **EC2 Instance**: Deployed virtual servers to run the application.
- 🏢 **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Ensured high availability and traffic distribution across instances.
- 💾 **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed and scaled the database with ease.
- 🗂️ **S3 Bucket**: Stored and managed static files for the application.
- 🛡️ **IAM Roles**: Configured and attached IAM roles to securely manage permissions and access control for various AWS resources.

The objective was to architect and deploy a resilient, highly available, and secure infrastructure, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and AWS best practices. Every component was provisioned, configured, and integrated through Terraform — ensuring consistency, repeatability, and version-controlled deployments.
For details about the application's features, functionality, and local installation, refer to the original README.md by Alejandro.

## 📌 Architectural Design Rationale:

### 🖥️ **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
   - Chosen over alternatives like App Runner, Lambda, and ECS for
   - Full control over the operating system, networking, and runtime environment.
   - Simplified deployment suitable for early-stage infrastructure learners.

### 🌐 **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
   - Implemented for Storing static files like images and assets in a scalable, durable, and cost-effective way.

### 💾 **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):**
   - Selected instead of DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless because:
   - The application relies on a relational schema with structured relationships.
   - RDS offers automated backups, encryption, and multi-AZ failover with minimal operational overhead.

### 🗂️ **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
   - Amazon S3 was used for static asset storage, ensuring cost-effective, durable, and highly available object storage.

### ⚙️ **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code):**
   - Terraform was adopted as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to provision and manage cloud infrastructure in a scalable, automated, and version-controlled manner.

## 6. 🔐 Security Considerations:
- Security was integrated into each layer of the infrastructure, following AWS security best practices and the principle of least privilege.

### 🌐 VPC Module  and Subnets

- **📁 Location:** `modules/vpc`  
- **📝 Description:**  
  Custom VPC design isolates public-facing and private resources:
   - Public subnets host the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to handle inbound traffic.
   -  Private subnets host EC2 instances and RDS, isolating sensitive services from direct internet access.
---

### 🛡️ Security Groups

- **📝 Description:**
  Security groups act as virtual firewalls to regulate traffic:
  - ALB Security Group: Allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet.
  - EC2 Security Group: Accepts traffic exclusively from the ALB.
  - RDS Security Group: Permits traffic only from EC2 instances within private subnets.

---

- **📝 Description:**  
  Defines scoped IAM roles granting EC2 instances secure, temporary permissions:
  - Enables controlled access to AWS services such as S3.

- **📝 Description:**  
  Manages sensitive data like database credentials securely:
  - Applications retrieve secrets programmatically at runtime.
  - Prevents embedding sensitive information in code or configuration files.
---
###  🔒 Encryption
- **📝 Description:**  
   Ensures data security at rest and in transit:
   - RDS storage and automated backups are encrypted at rest.
   - S3 bucket utilizes server-side encryption for all stored objects.
---

## 6. 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- To automate infrastructure provisioning and ensure consistency across environments, this project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). The CI/CD workflow is tailored to securely authenticate with AWS, generate environment-specific configurations, and run Terraform plans.

### 🔐 Secure AWS Access with OIDC and IAM Roles:
- Instead of using hardcoded AWS access keys or secrets in the pipeline, we use OIDC (OpenID Connect) to securely assume an IAM role directly from GitHub. This provides several key benefits:  
- **📝 Description:**  
  - Enhanced Security: No long-lived credentials are stored in GitHub — tokens are temporary and scoped.
  - Automatic Rotation: Tokens expire automatically, eliminating the need for manual key rotation.
  - Least Privilege Access: The IAM role has only the permissions required to run Terraform, minimizing the blast radius.
  - Tight Integration: GitHub’s native support for OIDC makes this setup seamless and cloud-native.
---
## 7. 🧩 Understanding Our GitHub Actions Strategy
- **📝 Description:**  
  During the GitHub Actions run:
  - The workflow authenticates to AWS using a role that trusts GitHub’s OIDC identity provider.
  - It dynamically generates a terraform.tfvars file by securely injecting values from GitHub Secrets. This includes whitelisted IPs, database credentials, AMI IDs, and more.
  - The Terraform CLI is then used to initialize the project and generate a plan using the configuration.
  - This design ensures that infrastructure deployments are secure, reproducible, and environmentally isolated, while still allowing dynamic configuration through centralized secrets' management.
  - By combining Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with secure CI/CD practices, this setup aligns with modern DevOps and cloud security best practices.
---
## 8 🚧 Future Developments

While the current infrastructure is functional and secure, there are several enhancements planned to improve scalability, maintainability, and observability:

- **Add Monitoring & Logging** using AWS CloudWatch and centralized logging for EC2/RDS metrics.
- **Implement Auto-scaling Policies** for EC2 instances based on CPU/memory thresholds.
- **Add Blue/Green Deployment Support** via separate target groups in the ALB.
- **Enable GitHub Actions Terraform Apply** in a secure, gated manner (e.g., with manual approvals).

# 11 🔧 Troubleshooting & FAQ

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|:--------|:---------------|:---------|
| **GitHub Actions workflow fails** | Incorrect IAM role ARN or missing secrets | Double-check GitHub repository secrets. Ensure all secrets are properly named and valid. |
| **Cannot SSH into EC2 instance** | Wrong key or wrong public IP address | Make sure you use the correct `.pem` key. Also check that your IP is whitelisted in the security group (`allowed_ssh_ip`). |
| **ALB DNS not reachable** | EC2 instances not registered or health check failures | Confirm target group health. Check security groups, and make sure the application server is running on the correct port. |
| **AWS CLI commands fail** | Misconfigured credentials or region | Re-run `aws configure` to fix credentials or region settings. |
| **RDS database not accessible** | Security group misconfiguration | Ensure the RDS security group allows incoming connections from the application server's security group. |

## 12 📋 FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q1: Can I deploy this app outside `eu-central-1` region?**  
> Yes! Update the region in `terraform.tfvars` and GitHub secrets. Make sure AMI IDs and other region-specific resources match your selected region.

**Q2: How can I customize the EC2 instance size?**  
> Modify the instance type in the Terraform configuration under `aws_launch_template` resource (example: `t3.micro`, `t3.medium`).

**Q3: What happens if the deployment fails midway?**  
> Terraform keeps a state file. You can fix the issue and re-run the workflow to continue. No need to start from scratch unless backend resources are broken.



**Q4: How to safely rotate secrets and access keys?**  
> - Rotate your keys in AWS IAM.
> - Update the new values in GitHub Secrets immediately.
> - Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow if needed.
