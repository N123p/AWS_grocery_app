## 📌 Architectural Design Rationale:

## 🧠 Architecture & Tooling Decisions

### 🖥️ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **Why EC2?**  
  EC2 was selected for full control over the OS, networking, and runtime—essential for learning infrastructure at a granular level. It allows SSH access, custom AMI usage, and fine-grained provisioning control.
- **Why not App Runner, Lambda, or ECS?**  
  These services abstract away too much for foundational infrastructure education. Lambda limits runtime flexibility, ECS adds orchestration complexity, and App Runner is optimized for containerized workloads without hands-on control.

---

### 🌐 Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Why ALB?**  
  ALB enables dynamic routing and health checks for multiple EC2 instances, supporting high availability and auto-scaling. It integrates easily with ASGs and provides rich metrics.

---

### 💾 Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
- **Why RDS?**  
  RDS was chosen to host a PostgreSQL database due to the application's reliance on a **relational data model with multiple interrelated tables** (e.g., users, products, orders). It ensures data integrity, supports complex SQL queries, and enables structured relationships across entities.
- **Why not DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless?**  
  DynamoDB lacks relational joins and is optimized for key-value and document access patterns—not suitable for this schema-heavy workload. Aurora Serverless adds dynamic complexity and may be overkill for early-stage deployments with predictable traffic.

---

### 🗂️ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **Why S3?**  
  Used for storing static assets like product images—it's durable, scalable, and cost-effective. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and supports lifecycle policies and versioning.
- **Why not EFS or EBS?**  
  Those are better for block-level or POSIX file systems—not object storage.

---

### ⚙️ Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Why Terraform?**  
  Terraform was selected for its provider-agnostic design, robust AWS module ecosystem, and remote state capabilities. It ensures reproducible, version-controlled deployments across environments.
- **Why not AWS CloudFormation or Pulumi?**  
  CloudFormation is AWS-only and has a steeper learning curve. Pulumi requires a general-purpose language like TypeScript or Python, which introduces extra complexity for infrastructure beginners. structure in a scalable, automated, and version-controlled manner.

  Manages sensitive data like database credentials or API keys securely using AWS Secrets Manager. This module creates and stores secrets, allowing secure access by applications or services without hardcoding sensitive values.


---
###  ⚙️ Root Module

- **📝 Description:**  
  Integrates all individual modules and manages global variables, outputs, and backend config.
-  **Purpose:**
   Serves as the central orchestrator for Terraform execution.
---

## 6. 🔐 Security Considerations:
- Security was integrated into each layer of the infrastructure, following AWS security best practices and the principle of least privilege.

### 🌐 VPC Module  and Subnets

- **📝 Description:**  
  Custom VPC design isolates public-facing and private resources:
   - Public subnets host the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to handle inbound traffic.
   -  Private subnets host EC2 instances and RDS, isolating sensitive services from direct internet access.
---

### 🛡️ Security Groups


- **📝 Description:**
  Security groups act as virtual firewalls to regulate traffic:
  - ALB Security Group: Allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet.
  - EC2 Security Group: Accepts traffic exclusively from the ALB.
  - RDS Security Group: Permits traffic only from EC2 instances within private subnets.

---

###  🔐 IAM Roles for EC2

- **📝 Description:**  
  Defines scoped IAM roles granting EC2 instances secure, temporary permissions:
  - Enables controlled access to AWS services such as S3.
  - Prevents hardcoding sensitive credentials within application code.

---
### 🔐 AWS Secrets Manager

- **📝 Description:**  
  Manages sensitive data like database credentials securely:
  - Applications retrieve secrets programmatically at runtime.
  - Prevents embedding sensitive information in code or configuration files.
---
###  🔒 Encryption
- **📝 Description:**  
   Ensures data security at rest and in transit:
   - RDS storage and automated backups are encrypted at rest.
   - S3 bucket utilizes server-side encryption for all stored objects.
---

## 6. 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- To automate infrastructure provisioning and ensure consistency across environments, this project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). The CI/CD workflow is tailored to securely authenticate with AWS, generate environment-specific configurations, and run Terraform plans.

### 🔐 Secure AWS Access with OIDC and IAM Roles:
- Instead of using hardcoded AWS access keys or secrets in the pipeline, we use OIDC (OpenID Connect) to securely assume an IAM role directly from GitHub. This provides several key benefits:  
- **📝 Description:**  
  - Enhanced Security: No long-lived credentials are stored in GitHub — tokens are temporary and scoped.
  - Automatic Rotation: Tokens expire automatically, eliminating the need for manual key rotation.
  - Least Privilege Access: The IAM role has only the permissions required to run Terraform, minimizing the blast radius.
  - Tight Integration: GitHub’s native support for OIDC makes this setup seamless and cloud-native.
---
## 7. 🧩 Understanding Our GitHub Actions Strategy
- **📝 Description:**  
  During the GitHub Actions run:
  - The workflow authenticates to AWS using a role that trusts GitHub’s OIDC identity provider.
  - It dynamically generates a terraform.tfvars file by securely injecting values from GitHub Secrets. This includes whitelisted IPs, database credentials, AMI IDs, and more.
  - The Terraform CLI is then used to initialize the project and generate a plan using the configuration.
  - This design ensures that infrastructure deployments are secure, reproducible, and environmentally isolated, while still allowing dynamic configuration through centralized secrets' management.
  - By combining Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with secure CI/CD practices, this setup aligns with modern DevOps and cloud security best practices.
---
## 8 🚧 Future Developments

While the current infrastructure is functional and secure, there are several enhancements planned to improve scalability, maintainability, and observability:

- **Add Monitoring & Logging** using AWS CloudWatch and centralized logging for EC2/RDS metrics.
- **Implement Auto-scaling Policies** for EC2 instances based on CPU/memory thresholds.
- **Add Blue/Green Deployment Support** via separate target groups in the ALB.
- **Enable GitHub Actions Terraform Apply** in a secure, gated manner (e.g., with manual approvals).
